Installation

I. Arrival

Surely on other days the old church would be less gray, its stones
less rough and soggy, the bulldozer harrows in the yard less full of
mud. Umbrella in his left hand and satchel in his, Balsam gazed around
the church and at the gritty neighborhood around it till the door
opened by the hand of a young man in a jacket and tie.

"Ah, Henry Balsam," said the man warmly. "Welcome to your
congregation.  I'm deacon DEACON." Wan and thin, his face was as
entirely smooth, his light brown skin stretched across it a if on a
loom.  They shook hands, muttered preliminary words of
acquaintanceship, and headed down a hall whose edges were traced in
dust--evidence of ongoing renovations.

DEACON opened a wooden door leading to an odd-shaped nook, twice as
wide as it was deep. "I apologize for the makeshift office," he
said. "The renovation turned the old pastor's office into a playroom
for the children."

"I'm not fussy about space," Balsam reassured him.

"The chair of the board can't be here till tomorrow, unfortunately,"
DEACON said. "She's quite busy--head of a social work division. But
she'll text us before she drops by, and there's a trustee meeting on
Thursday evening where you can meet everyone. The installation will be
at the Sunday service, of course."

"I'm new at this work, as you know," answered Balsam. "How do you
suggest I get to learn about the church and its needs? Are there historical
and financial books I could peruse?"

"Certainly--I have a pile already assembled in the library, along with
more files of the sort we emailed you last week."

And before letting Balsam settle in the squeezed gap between the desk
and the wall, DEACON gave him a ring of keys, quickly explaining the
purpose of each, and invited him to stay for the daily soup kitchen at
5:00.

Balsam drummed his fingers on the oak desk top. During his final days
at campus and his train trip, he had maintained a staunch
practicality, knowing that he was a mere student being brought into a
pastorage for which he wasn't prepared, but promising to leap into the
role with professionalism. But the past few weeks had been wrenching,
and he could forgive himself for a few moments of dawdling.

Eventually he set himself to reading the documents DEACON had left
him, and just when his mind started to focus, a knock came to the
door.

"Excuse me, reverend," said DEACON. "Could you take a few minutes to
meet with one of our congregants?"

DEACON was replaced by a middle-aged woman with a powerful jaw and
fierce eyes, INHERITOR being her name. Behind her smile seemed to lay
a legacy. She took Balsam's right hand firmly and sat in the armchair
that barely fit next to his desk.

They made their introductions, and INHERITOR waxed eloquently about
the fine status of the city where Balsam was making his new home.

"I'm a docent in four different institutions of the city," INHERITOR
said, "for my family has been responsible for many of the great
buildings, including a museum and business school."

Balsam had already judged from INHERITOR's jeweled pendant and
clothing of gray restraint that she could speak for considerable
money. He allowed her to explain her father's good works in the city.

"His endowment renovated the central library, and we were explicitly
asked whether we wanted his name on it. We refused, because our
mission is the betterment of our community, not vulgar
self-advertisement. The building is called simply Central Circle
Library, to this day."

Without vulgar self-advertisement, INHERITOR allowed it to come out
during the conversation that her parents had been equally generous to
the church. "And that's why I dropped by to ask for my father to be
recognized with burial in the courtyard."

When Balsam gave a blank look, INHERITOR clearly showed some
agitation. So he had not been told that the current renovation had
removed obstacles from the courtyard, opening enough space for a
burial. That Eventide Church had decided to honor one of their leading
members with burial in this prominent spot. And that the pastor was to
choose the person thus honored.

"I am aware of the tradition of burial next to a church, of course,"
said Balsam. "But no one mentioned this as one of my
responsibilities."

INHERITOR waved a casual hand. "Of course we have many more pressing
tasks at Eventide, reverend. We minister to our members and to the
local residents. You'll have much to think about, obviously. So it
would be useful to take care of this burial issue and get it over
with."

"I find it an unusual responsibility, particularly for a person brand
new to the  job. I will talk to the deacon and the board and get back
to you as fast as I can. IS that acceptable?"

"Let me offer some counsel on that, reverend. You must talk to them,
of course, but you'll find that they went through the issue a good
nine months ago, when it was realized that the renovation was opening
up the space for a grave site, and they decided the choice was the
pastor's responsibility. So you'll just be unsealing old decisions
they probably don't want to revisit."

"And the pastor who was here before me didn't make the decision?"

"Unfortunately, no, Reverend George did not resolve it before
leaving. His departure was sudden."

"Thanks, INHERITOR. I'll certainly try to act on this issue in a timely
manner."

Balsam did not let himself consider the burial question any more that
afternoon, but delved instead into his stack of documents. He also had
access to several years' worth of financial records, and despite his
limited exposure to organizational budgeting as a former divinity
student, he forced himself to scan them. As might be expected, the
renovation of the historic building had called for more money than
expected, so although the congregation was in pretty good financial
shape, their recent expenditures had stressed their funds, the
beneficence of the INHERITOR familiy notwithstanding.

Escaping from his stifling office for a brief lunch alone in the
kitchen, he took a tour of the church. His keys let him into every
room, where he imagined he might learn more about the congregation
than he could from spreadsheets and formal records. The children's
play room didn't strike him as well chosen. The windows were too high
for a young child to look out, and the tables were constrained by the
shae of the room. Overall, the change of office left both the
children's room and his paltry chamber unsatisfactory--nothing like
the lavish update to the sanctuary. The renovation had scrupulously
restored both the original design and the original materials, which
had by no means been modest in their own day. Balsam speculated that,
if Mr. INHERITOR could see the good use to which his legacy had been
put in the restoration, he might not feel the need for his body to be
dragged back and interred next to it.

The soup kitchen was cheerful and the diners well-manners, although
they didn't relax their scowls or share a word with each other. He had
worked in many a soup kitchen and found this to be one with all the
rest. The volunteers greeted him enthusiastically.

But on the way back to his apartment for a meager cheese sandwich and
an apple, Balsam viewed the brick and clapboard around him
differently. Now he rated each open spot or stairwell as a
restingplace, guessing that many of them played that role each night.

II. Confession

The rain had lifted the next day, and Balsam saw Eventide Church in a
kinder light. The ruts in the courtyard reminded him of INHERITOR's
request, so he asked DEACON how the issue had arisen.

"I apologize, Reverend," said DEACON. "In the rush to interview and
hire you, nobody had a moment to explain this matter about a grave
site. There are actually three leading members of the church who want
a relative buried there, and with room for only one, a certain amount
of polite maneuvering has been going on during the past six months."

"It seems that the board didn't want to be saddled with the decision."

"They hoped that the old pastor, who had been here twenty-six years,
could handle it, but after he left, they relegated it to you."

"Me alone?," asked Balsam, feeling more and more exposed.

"Indeed, it's a small task but a thorny one," DEACON agreed. All three
are part of multi-generational member families, and are generous in
their support. In fact, one is coming to see you today. Did you check
you calendar? He is taking you out to lunch."

UPSTART turned out to be a slightly stocky, energetic young man in a
fine suit, his wispy blond hair just a bit longer than is
standard. The restaurant to which he took Balsam was elegant, with
green tableclothes and exposed wood beams, but UPSTART treated their
visit as casually as if he was munching on a pizza at the corner shop.
They talked about Balsam's student past and UPSTART congratulated him
on getting a fine placement. "Our church has occupied an honored place
for over a century," he said. "I intend to help you take it to new
heights.

UPSTART explained, "The need in the community is greater than ever,
and a soup kitchen is only a small easing of people's pain. We're
participating in some housing and job training efforts in the city,
but I'd love to see a bold initiative. My family is so lucky to be
supporting much of the city. Like many places, our factories have been
reduced, but we still provide employment to a considerable percentage
of the population. And a set of attached clinics started by my uncles
are thriving."

After they talked about some of the community efforts, UPSTART
bantered about his brother, sisters, uncles--various branches of the
family who had been central to Eventide Church. Balsam knew how the
conversation would turn. Which of the deceased had UPSTART chosen for
the coveted spot in the courtyard?

"And they all go back to grandfather GRANDFATHER," said UPSTART. "He
was a lion of the community, and he's the main person I want to tell
you about today. GRANDFATHER

---

Suddenly a fury coursed through him. He had been lured into a [] of
licentiousness. He was the cover-up for a crime no one would talk
about, a crime so horrible that the goodly church folk couldn't even
let themselves gaze into Pastor George's old office. By one man's
disobedience many were made sinners.

A bustle around the food table contrasted with the meek orderliness of
the indigent people at the free evening meals, leading Bolsom to
speculate who needed the ministrations of Eventide more.
