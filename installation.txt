Installation

Surely on other days the old church would be less gray, its stones
less rough and soggy, the bulldozer harrows in the yard less full of
mud. Umbrella in his left hand and satchel in his, Balsam gazed around
the church and at the gritty neighborhood around it till the door
opened by the hand of a young man in a jacket and tie.

"Ah, Henry Balsam," said the man warmly. "Welcome to your congregation.
I'm deacon DEACON." Wan and thin, his face as smooth as if his light
brown skin had been stretched across it like a loom, he stood back to
let Balsam in. They shook hands, muttered preliminary words of
acquaintanceship, and headed down a hall whose edges were traced in
dust--more evidence of the ongoing renovations.

DEACON opened a wooden door leading to an odd-shaped nook, twice as
wide as it was deep. "I apologize for the makeshift office," he
said. "The renovation turned the old pastor's office into a rec room
and classroom for the children."

"I'm not fussy about space," Balsam reassured him.

"The chair of the board can't be here till tomorrow, unfortunately,"
DEACON said. "She's quite busy--head of a social work division. But
she'll text us before she drops by, and there's a board meeting on
Thursday evening where you can meet everyone. The installation will be
at the Sunday service, of course."

"I'm new at this work, as you know," answered Balsam. "How do you
suggest I get to learn about the church and its needs? Are there historical
and financial books I could peruse?"

"Certainly--I have a pile already assembled in the library, along with
more files of the sort we emailed you last week."

And before letting Balsam settle in the squeezed gap between the desk
and the wall, DEACON gave him a ring of keys, quickly explaining the
purpose of each, and invited him to stay for the daily soup kitchen
they ran at 5:00.

A bustle around the food table contrasted with the meek orderliness of the indigent people at last night's free meal, leading Bolsom to speculate who needed the ministrations of CHURCH more.
