Mindful writing, with Sara Epstein online at Temple Shir Tikvah

March 20, 2020

Bruce asked me about the book I'm reading. It seems his wife is
obsessed with Japanese literature. I don't know any Japanese
literature (except the first few pages of two novels that didn't
interest me), but I found this anthology in the used books section of
Brookline Booksmith. So now I'm trying to read the anthology real fast
so I can give it to Bruce's wife. The problem is, the storied don't
particularly interest me. Do you see a trend? But I shelled out seven
dollars for this book and I'm not giving it away until I finish it.

My congressional rep is in a fix. Actually, all 500 odd congressional
reps are in the same fix, along with thousands of other
politicians. They can't serve new terms until they win elections. But
they can't win elections without being on the ballot, and they can't
go on the ballot without hundreds of signatures on nominating
papers. You know how candidates get signatures on nominating
papers. Volunteers go door-to-door or downtown. But we can't do that
now. So my rep sent me nominating papers and asked me to sign them and
mail them back. The cost must be tremendous. And how does she know
whom to mail them to? You gotta be really connected to succeed with
this method. She knows I support her. So not only did Judy and I sign
them, I slipped them through my neighbors' mail slot and got their
signatures. Double mitzvah, double the political power.

Submerged sea creatures
Blooms, unblooms
Sticks
Multigreens
The nature show attract predictable artistic responses
If all the flowers in the room came alive, the scents would floor us
But there's little left in the Internet images
You want those feature-tickle brushstrokes, the shadows under shadows murmuring from the corners of the canvas
Alas, the show was on vies only four days
There was never an official opening
The building suffered a deep cleansing at that hour instead
Who will ever see this art, this nature?
Each artist will flaunt her own piece
But there's an art lacking
It was the art of all of the pieces together
And that condensed only for a brief flicker of a moment and dispersed again
I wish I could close my eyes and see it again
The memory persists, but the brushstrokes are cut away

I saw the two cacti on my south-facing window today, the stalks of the
succulents interweaving with the branches still bare on the bushes
outside. The succulents were left by my child and their partner when
we forced them out of the house two years ago. I don't fraternize
heavily with the plants my child left me. I practice social distancing
with them except once a week, when I give them water and prune the
brown detritus left by my inadequate watering of the previous
week. But now, having just read an article in WIRED Magazine about how
plants can save us from climate disruption, i appreciate the oxygen
quietly wafting from my succulents into the room. A lot of us will
need a lot of oxygen over the coming months. I am happy my child left
me my own supply.

It was living high off the hog. I got to work from home. I had long
stretches of nothing to do, but raked in the salary of a senior editor
even though I had transitioned out of those responsibilities years
before. When my managers presented me with a writing project, I could
always turn in a a draft faster and better than they had asked for,
and they expressed appreciation. Usually, these drafts would come out
on the web or in print with my name in bright white letters, flaunting
my powers to the community.

But after the layoff, I realized that even the most congenial,
well-worn path is still a rut. I was not too old to need new
challenges. Coasting, as I had been allowed to do, had reduced my
energy level, but after the layoff I have been sleeping less. I've
shed a few of my extra pounds. I get up each day thinking of things I
want to do that overflow the time I have: job applications, articles,
freelance work, poems, Jewish tests to study, political campaigns, and
of course all the bureaucracy that accompanies job endings. People
tell me to process my loss and grieve, but I'll have to wait for the
Sabbath to do that. Even then, we are not allowed to grieve on the
Sabbath.

---

Sure, it was hard telling my child and their partner that they had to
move out. Friends who had been through the same rupture--so many
families have had to do it--told us we needed to impose a limit. The
patner told me they rented a moving van because they were afraid I
would just thrust their possessions out on the street. Well, that
shows how necessary the threat was (even if imagined). But after a
couple weeks, the separation restored our relationship. Since then, it
has ranged (and even alternated) between the two of them blocking
texts and email from us to having my child accompany us each week to
religious services. And we never know what will come, or whether this
chaos will end.

It's a good thing I went out to mail letters today. I wanted to get to
the mailbox, despite heavy rain, to send 40 postcards to voters in
Georgia to make sure they are registered. I also sent letters to my
state legislators to complain about the state's failure to provide
unemployment benefits. On the porch I noticed a wet spot, and waited
till I saw the drip that had created it. Later, Judy and I checked,
and found wetter spots. Three drips.

This was almost a welcome intrusion into our space by nature. Our
house feels so sealed up. We do not want the outside air. Along with
the late winter chill, it brings viruses. We are sealed in. We
rebreathe our own breath, leavened only by the a bit of fresh oxygen
from our houseplants.

All the books and magazines I consult lie before me. I made a pile
last night to clear space for dinner. ike our sealed house, a single
ungainly pile provides me with my monthly WIRED magazine, my Medicare
guide, my Hebrew textbooks, and anything else I come across.

---

Ungainly: who cleans their house any more? We pay our housekeeper to
stay home and stay alive.I am supporting members of my own family, and
supporting hers. The house grows hoary with our scattered possessions.
My hair is a shaggy mat. Projects I desperately took on to fill the
emplty days are spreading like a pool of molasses. Where do I put all
the leftovers we cooked?

When I no longer can find things, I'll know it's time to clean.

I owe visits to several relatives. One visit would be simple. We even
started to plan the trip. We have a niece with a five-year-old we
don't know well and an infant. They're in Southern California, and it
would be great to visit Joshua Tree National Park while hanging out
with them. Another trip could be Philadelphia, where I have cousins
whom I treasure but don't get to see much. They used not to show
effort to get together, but appreciate me more in recent years.

Other trips are more fraught with both logistical and emotional
difficulties. One of my brothers is in Thailand. I love him and
respect him, but his personal style starts to grate after a couple
days--so how to shape a trip to Southest Asia around him while
limiting our time together? My other borther presents perplexing
barriers too. He is friendly and supportive, but prefers to see me
only for one short dinner in a restaurant per visit. I have a couple
other acquaintances I enjoy seeing in that part of Northern
California, but it would be an expensive visit for just a few meetings
the each take up a couple hours.

My intuition tells me that I will make all these visits. The pull of
family is a deep current in the ocean of fellowship. The richness of
the interactions will expand these short visits beyond the boundaries
of their duration.

Leslie Lawrence's "I am from" writing exercise

Idea from NPR Morning Edition

April 5, 2020

I am ffrom dogwoods, mowing lawns, charcoal grills

I am from the reel-to-reel tape deck on which my brothers and I recorded all the brashest music of the 1960s

I am from civil rights protesters, peace marchers who stayed in our home

I am from joke books, vocabulary-building books, Mad

From the sand lot where we played softball and the street not too busy for a child to cross to get to the sand lot

I am from Lawry's Seasoned Salt, which could be added to any dish. Its chemicals are probably still lodged in my fat

Speaking of fat

I am from Hostess cupcakes

I am from the blackboard built into the wall where we'd scribble for hours

From the piano four out of five family members played

From the local library. I was so excited to get to use the adult section years after I was ready for it

From the D Suzuki book that gave me a deep understanding of Buddhism, City Without Jews by Hugo Bettauer, the complete Ring cycle in the best renditions (somebody at the library must have understood music)

I am from the window poles we used in the sweltering Springs of Washington DC to let air into the classroom, the structured learning books in red and orange that taught me the New Math. I am probably the only student in that classroom to ever make practical use of the New Math

From vaporizers and Vicks VaporRub, bread with jam but no butter because my mother was convinced butter was bad for a cold. Why she thought I wanted the jam I don't know, because I never liked the jam, almost always grape, but I dutifully at it because...well, because I had a cold

From the bamboo forest on a hidden plot of land down a long driveway at the other end of my block

From science fiction books bearing the must of the basement where I always sat to read them

From Roadrunner cartoons that should by all assessments have turned me into mass murderer

So path was definitely uphill

The swoosh of air just came through a floor vent, indicating that the
heat came on. Just for a moment. As we enter the second half of April
in Boston, cold snaps are still encircling us. I saw snow during the
first hours of dawn yesterday. I heard later that this divertissement
was granted only to those living in the Heights. Judy braved the cold
recently to take a walk, but I've been exrcising inside.

When winter first lifted, we welcomed the bright, longer days with
their still chipper air. But now I'm ready for real Spring. Lacking a
reason to leave the house--and being implored to stay within it as
much as I can, in fact--I need the beneficence of warm weather to pull
me out.

And next, I think of people not privileged enough to have a nice warm
room, or not privileged enough to stay in from working, or not
privileged enough to have space where they can escape for an hour from
the rest of the family. The brief rush of air from a floor vent
brought me each of these thoughts.

---

The heat has come back on, and is staying on, thrusting air noisily
through the floor vents for minutes at a time. While it's catching up
with the unnoticeable chill that must have come over the house while I
was just writing, I think back to the rush of hot air that would wash
over us all last winter.

It was an  indolent time. We stayed in a lot. Winter is the most
hectic season for the arts, with theater shows and concerts and museum
openings piling up on top of one another, but we were supporting my
adult child and partner last winter, so we curtailed our
entertainments.

I was out downtown near my old job a couple times during the bustle
just preceding Christmas, and came home to write a poem about the halo
gathering over the scene, where buses and shops and pedestrians were
all taken up with activity. I still have people and places that I deal
with near Downtown Crossing, and it's strange to think that after the
pandemic has eased I will return to those places so familiar from the
years working for my old company. I hope my sedentary habits don't
stick around. I know that all the arts organizations are fervently,
anxiously hoping for that too. Meanwhile, I'm home. It's national
poetry month, a good month to sit back and write nine poems.

Sara asked us, as she does every week, to look out of our
windows. Today, instead, I looked out of Sara's window, as it was
visible in our Zoom conference. The purple and yellow flowers on her
window sill were enthralling. but I remembered that one of my house
plants had also bloomed a couple weeks ago. The plant had been left by
our child and their partner when we forced them to get out and get
their own apartment. Even after seeing the slender white bloom we had
no idea what the plant was.

The memory made me think of what it's like to spend 23 hours a day in
the house I have lived in for some 37 years. What have I not noticed
before in this house? I found that out while doing a meditation online
a couple weeks ago led by Peter Feinmann. Although I was rarely able
to suspend my racing thoughts--meditation does not come to me with
ease--I did look around in a mentally open state and saw my living
room as I had not really seen it for decades. Surveying languidly the
antiques, the heirloom book collection, the Oriental, and the photos,
I realized what a beautiful home Judy and I had made: a home of
precious objects, of repose, of love.

I am glad we did not sell this house before COVID-19 hit. It is a
familiar house. My home for nearly my entire adult life, it is the
home I want whan I can't go out in the world.

In my initial piece today, I used both the words "flower" and "bloom"
for variety. These are essentially synonyms, whether used as nouns or
as verbs. It is lovely to have choices in the English language,
drawing deeply from both the Romance and the Germanic languages. When
I think of Bloom, I think of the lead character in Joyce. This is an
idle period for many people, a time they can undertake a substantial
reading project they might balk at other times. I have read Ulysses
already. Also War and Peace and other major Russian novels. Almost all
of Dickens, all of Shakespeare. Well, plenty is left for me. I started
Don Quixote in both Spanish and English a few years ago, but my
efforts petered out. Several tomes by George Eliot line my
shelves. I'm not even considering modern authors such as Pynchon and
Stephenson.

But my major excursion into big reading is the study of the entire
Bablyonian Talmud, which I started back in January with tens of
thousands of others in the seven-and-a-half year Daf Yomi cycle. This
is a community project. We form a community in my synagogue and on a
Facebook page people post to from around the world.

I am very disciplined in my Facebook postings. Unlike others, I don't
muse about my personal habits and their stochastic relationshps to
rabbinic throughts from 2000 years ago. I don't navel-gaze and try to
find a facile spirituality in activities that the ancients conceived
to be plenty spiritual already. I do post about dilemmas in the text,
about subtleties in the Hebrew that can illuminate meaning, and about
implications of rulings.

May 1, 2020

There used to be a popular poster that consisted of nothing but photos
of doors. Doors of houses, churches, painted in beautiful colors or
weathered by centuries. After a trip to Prague, where Judy was
hyper-alert to doors, she put together on Snapfish her own poster of
doors. But I wondered today why she hung her poster right inside our
own front door. Like Magritte, was she wryly contrasting reality with
artistic fiction? Right now, her 15 or 16 door seem to beckon me to a
wider world, one which is denied to me as I cannot trespass beyond our
own door.

I did venture out today, however, although rain was pelting the
concrete at 9 AM. I was on the noblest of missions, headed to one of
those most essential institutions, the liquor store. It was indeed a
noble venture, because Judy and I had carefully nursed our wine
colleciton over the past several weeks down to one bottle of red. But
tonight is Shabbat, and Judy prefers white. Hence the trip to my old
stand-by, Mall Liquors at Fresh Pond.

But what's this? A lone figure standing outside a darkened door.
Someone with groceries. He didn't speak to me. Was he waiting to be
picked up? Or hoping to gain entry to the liquor store? If the latter,
he was looking forward to an hour in the rain, because Mall Liquors
had imperiously decided to delay opening by an hour--and hadn't
updated their web site.

Luckily, I hopped over to Say-Mor Liquors across the the highway, open
when they said they'd be. I will return no more to Mall Liquors.
Updating a web site would take 30 seonds--I've done it innumerable
times. I have no patience for a business that disrespects its faithful
customers.

Coming home, I learned that Ed Markey had collected all the signatures
he needed for nominating papers. It reminded me that there's even a
bigger world out there. I try to remain a part of it. I managed to
sign Markey's nominating papers (along with Katherine Clark's) even
though the campgaign never sent them to me, thanks to a local friend
who brought me a copy.

Reality is further than ever from me these days. As a kid, I learned
how tenuous reality is. I was playing bridge one pleasant Spring
evening in our house in Washington, DC when I was twelve years
old. Not until the next morning did we open the newspaper to learn
that the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. had been killed. Others were not
so behind the times as we. Many had been out destroying 14th and U,
and other parts of black Washington. We were traumatized that morning
not only by the political tragedy, not only by the brutal, raw
violence, but by our privileged ignorance. My father watched the 10:00
or 11:00 news every night from then on.

I never know about wars, earthquakes, or bombings except through the
news. But now I feel I know nothing at all. I depend on media or
friends, both bearing their biases and limited attentions, for
everything outside the signals my stomach gives me when it's time to
eat.

But there are compensations for this obliviousness of existence. I am
more in touch with the inner fantastic world of my own cerebral lobes.
I have written 16 poems this past month, in honor of National Poetry
Month. Two have been published. I think poets are the people willing
to approach mostly closely the edge of their own derangement--at
least, those who do so but pull back before tumbling in. If other
people can be kind enough to hear my fabulous truth, as I hear theirs,
the perilous journey will be worth it.
