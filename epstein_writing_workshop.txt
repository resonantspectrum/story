Mindful writing, with Sara Epstein

March 20, 2020

Bruce asked me about the book I'm reading. It seems his wife is
obsessed with Japanese literature. I don't know any Japanese
literature (except the first few pages of two novels that didn't
interest me), but I found this anthology in the used books section of
Brookline Booksmith. So now I'm trying to read the anthology real fast
so I can give it to Bruce's wife. The problem is, the storied don't
particularly interest me. Do you see a trend? But I shelled out seven
dollars for this book and I'm not giving it away until I finish it.

My congressional rep is in a fix. Actually, all 500 odd congressional
reps are in the same fix, along with thousands of other
politicians. They can't serve new terms until they win elections. But
they can't win elections without being on the ballot, and they can't
go on the ballot without hundreds of signatures on nominating
papers. You know how candidates get signatures on nominating
papers. Volunteers go door-to-door or downtown. But we can't do that
now. So my rep sent me nominating papers and asked me to sign them and
mail them back. The cost must be tremendous. And how does she know
whom to mail them to? You gotta be really connected to succeed with
this method. She knows I support her. So not only did Judy and I sign
them, I slipped them through my neighbors' mail slot and got their
signatures. Double mitzvah, double the political power.

Submerged sea creatures
Blooms, unblooms
Sticks
Multigreens
The nature show attract predictable artistic responses
If all the flowers in the room came alive, the scents would floor us
But there's little left in the Internet images
You want those feature-tickle brushstrokes, the shadows under shadows murmuring from the corners of the canvas
Alas, the show was on vies only four days
There was never an official opening
The building suffered a deep cleansing at that hour instead
Who will ever see this art, this nature?
Each artist will flaunt her own piece
But there's an art lacking
It was the art of all of the pieces together
And that condensed only for a brief flicker of a moment and dispersed again
I wish I could close my eyes and see it again
The memory persists, but the brushstrokes are cut away
