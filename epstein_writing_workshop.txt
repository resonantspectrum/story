Mindful writing, with Sara Epstein online at Temple Shir Tikvah

Bruce asked me about the book I'm reading. It seems his wife is
obsessed with Japanese literature. I don't know any Japanese
literature (except the first few pages of two novels that didn't
interest me), but I found this anthology in the used books section of
Brookline Booksmith. So now I'm trying to read the anthology real fast
so I can give it to Bruce's wife. The problem is, the storied don't
particularly interest me. Do you see a trend? But I shelled out seven
dollars for this book and I'm not giving it away until I finish it.

My congressional rep is in a fix. Actually, all 500 odd congressional
reps are in the same fix, along with thousands of other
politicians. They can't serve new terms until they win elections. But
they can't win elections without being on the ballot, and they can't
go on the ballot without hundreds of signatures on nominating
papers. You know how candidates get signatures on nominating
papers. Volunteers go door-to-door or downtown. But we can't do that
now. So my rep sent me nominating papers and asked me to sign them and
mail them back. The cost must be tremendous. And how does she know
whom to mail them to? You gotta be really connected to succeed with
this method. She knows I support her. So not only did Judy and I sign
them, I slipped them through my neighbors' mail slot and got their
signatures. Double mitzvah, double the political power.

Submerged sea creatures
Blooms, unblooms
Sticks
Multigreens
The nature show attract predictable artistic responses
If all the flowers in the room came alive, the scents would floor us
But there's little left in the Internet images
You want those feature-tickle brushstrokes, the shadows under shadows murmuring from the corners of the canvas
Alas, the show was on vies only four days
There was never an official opening
The building suffered a deep cleansing at that hour instead
Who will ever see this art, this nature?
Each artist will flaunt her own piece
But there's an art lacking
It was the art of all of the pieces together
And that condensed only for a brief flicker of a moment and dispersed again
I wish I could close my eyes and see it again
The memory persists, but the brushstrokes are cut away

I saw the two cacti on my south-facing window today, the stalks of the
succulents interweaving with the branches still bare on the bushes
outside. The succulents were left by my child and their partner when
we forced them out of the house two years ago. I don't fraternize
heavily with the plants my child left me. I practice social distancing
with them except once a week, when I give them water and prune the
brown detritus left by my inadequate watering of the previous
week. But now, having just read an article in WIRED Magazine about how
plants can save us from climate disruption, i appreciate the oxygen
quietly wafting from my succulents into the room. A lot of us will
need a lot of oxygen over the coming months. I am happy my child left
me my own supply.

It was living high off the hog. I got to work from home. I had long
stretches of nothing to do, but raked in the salary of a senior editor
even though I had transitioned out of those responsibilities years
before. When my managers presented me with a writing project, I could
always turn in a a draft faster and better than they had asked for,
and they expressed appreciation. Usually, these drafts would come out
on the web or in print with my name in bright white letters, flaunting
my powers to the community.

But after the layoff, I realized that even the most congenial,
well-worn path is still a rut. I was not too old to need new
challenges. Coasting, as I had been allowed to do, had reduced my
energy level, but after the layoff I have been sleeping less. I've
shed a few of my extra pounds. I get up each day thinking of things I
want to do that overflow the time I have: job applications, articles,
freelance work, poems, Jewish tests to study, political campaigns, and
of course all the bureaucracy that accompanies job endings. People
tell me to process my loss and grieve, but I'll have to wait for the
Sabbath to do that. Even then, we are not allowed to grieve on the
Sabbath.

Sure, it was hard telling my child and their partner that they had to
move out. Friends who had been through the same rupture--so many
families have had to do it--told us we needed to impose a limit. The
patner told me they rented a moving van because they were afraid I
would just thrust their possessions out on the street. Well, that
shows how necessary the threat was (even if imagined). But after a
couple weeks, the separation restored our relationship. Since then, it
has ranged (and even alternated) between the two of them blocking
texts and email from us to having my child accompany us each week to
religious services. And we never know what will come, or whether this
chaos will end.
