Rewording

When we all pick ourselves up, we will leave behind many words.

We will no longer say that events far away have no significance

    or that there are just too many who suffer to help them all.

We won't say that the air or the land or the water are too hard to clean

    or that some workers are easily replaceable.

We won't say that we can't find the money to address a crisis

    or that we must take things slowly because people can't adapt to change.

We won't lecture nations thrown into the pit to drag themselves out.

We won't say that anyone is unneeded.

What we will say is,

I am here.
